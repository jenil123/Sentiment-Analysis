# Sentiment-Analysis
This project is part of out mini project.
We have collected review data for our project
The only preprocessing task done is tokenizing the sentence. 
We did not perform stop words removal because we want context of the sentence.
We trained a LSTM model and after training we got a accuracy of 81% on train set and 76% on test set
The model was able to get context of the sentence as we used bag of words model.
